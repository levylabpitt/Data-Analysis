This folder contains LabVIEW examples of how to read Photon-HDF5 files in LabVIEW.

The example VIs are saved for LabVIEW 2010 on Windows.

To use these VIs, prior installation of the free and open-source HDF5 LabVIEW API "h5Labview" (http://h5labview.sourceforge.net/) is needed in order to provide HDF5 read/write functionalities within LabVIEW.

The example uses version 2.11.2.137 of h5labview, which also requires prior installation of HDF5 library v. 1.8.14 or newer from http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/.

In order to get it to work, you may have to follow this advice from the h5labview website: 

> Once you've installed HDF5, copy hdf5.dll, szip.dll and zlib.dll from the "bin" folder of the installation directory to LabVIEW's resource folder. This will ensure LabVIEW locates the correct version.
